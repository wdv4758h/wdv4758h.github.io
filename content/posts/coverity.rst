    In 2006, the Coverity Scan service was initiated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as the largest public-private sector research project in the world, focused on open source software quality and security. Coverity now manages the project, providing its development testing technology as a free service to the open source community to help them build quality and security into their software development process.
