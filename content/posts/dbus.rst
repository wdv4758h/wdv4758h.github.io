Basic Linux IPC

D-Bus
========================================

D-Bus is a message bus system for inter-process communication (``IPC``)

* `D-Bus <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/D-Bus>`_
* `Wikipedia - D-Bus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus>`_
* `Freedesktop - Introduction to D-Bus <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/IntroductionToDBus/>`_
* `Linux From Scratch - D-Bus <http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/dbus.html>`_
* `D-Bus Specification <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html>`_

D-Bus is enabled automatically when using systemd because dbus is a dependency of systemd.

What's D-Bus
------------------------------

* a powerful IPC system
* the closest thing to a standard in this area as can be found on Linux
* provides a nice method-call transaction mechanism
* has fundamental inefficiencies of the user-space implementation
    - well suited to control tasks
        + works well to tell a sound server to change the volume
    - less so for anything that has to carry significant amounts of data
        + one would not want to try to send the actual audio data over the bus
* In D-Bus a call-return message requires ``10 message copies``, ``4 message validations``, ``4 context switches``
* D-Bus has ``no timestamps on messages``
* not available at early boot
* **We need a better implementation** -> ``kdbus``

D-Bus - Architecture
------------------------------

* libdbus
* dbus-daemon
* wrapper libraries based on particular application frameworks

Interesting : ::

    In 2013 the systemd project rewrote libdbus in an effort to simplify the code, but it turned out to significantly increase the performance of D-Bus as well.
    In preliminary benchmarks, BMW found that the systemd D-Bus library increased performance by 360%.

kdbus
========================================

* `D-Bus in the kernel [linux.conf.au 2014] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgR6d54blrU>`_

    - Linux Kernel only have primitives IPC : sockets, FIFOs, and shared memory
    - kdbus is a **in-kernel implementation of D-Bus**
        + can carry large amounts of data
            * even used for gigabyte-sized message streams
        + have zero-copy message passing
        + worst case : ``2 copy operations``, ``2 validations``, ``2 context switches``
        + all messages carry timestamps
        + full credential information (user ID, process ID, SELinux label, control group information, capabilities, and much more) is passed with each message
        + always available to the system (no need to wait for the D-Bus daemon to be started)
        + Linux security modules can hook into it directly
        + various race conditions have been fixed
        + API has simplified
        + Kdbus is implemented as a ``character device`` in the kernel
        + signal broadcasting mechanism has been rewritten to use Bloom filters to select recipients
        + There is a user-space proxy server that can be used by older code that has not been rewritten to use the new API, so everything should just work on a kdbus-enabled system with no code changes required.
    - the new ``memfd`` syscall was merged into Linux kernel 3.17
        + ``memfd`` is a mechanism similar to Android's ``ashmem`` that allows ``zero-copy`` message passing in KDBUS.
    - Android "ashmem" subsystem
    - Android Binder

    - Binder vs. kdbus
    - Binder is bound to the CPU, D-Bus (and hence kdbus), is bound to RAM
